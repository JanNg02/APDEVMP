                        </br>Animal Science ALLERGY-EASE (Immune System Support Formula)
                        </br>60 Chewable Tablets 
                        </br>Animal Science ALLERGY-EASE Chewables helps support normal respiratory function and health in dogs with a potent combination of antioxidants and omega fatty acids. It also supports the immune system and assists the body in combating environmental pollutants.
                        </br>KEY COMPONENTS:
                        </br>- QUERCETIN and CITRUS BIOFLAVONOIDS inhibit allergic and inflammatory responses by inhibiting the release of antibodies that cause histamine to be released.
                        </br>- VITAMIN C increases the function of many immune cells, including those that destroy invader cells. As an antioxidant, ascorbic acid protects cell from free radicals that can cause tissue damage and disease. It also has antihistamine properties that help relieve allergy symptoms.
                        </br>- VITAMIN E is a fat-soluble vitamin that acts as a free radicals scavenger, protects cell membranes and prevents damage to enzymes.
                        </br>- GREEN TEA EXTRACT contains several active constituents that prevent cell receptors from triggering an allergic response.
                        </br>- PANTOTHENIC ACID is involved in the production of adrenal hormones and antibodies produced by the body's white blood cells.
                        </br>- OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS such as DHA(Docosalhexaenoic Acid) and EPA(Eicosapentaenoic Acid) help reduce inflammatory skin reactions in dogs. These two important fatty acids are found in high levels in fish oil. Only omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil have been shown to reduce inflammation. Additionally, fish oil can suppress B- and T-lymphocyte synthesis and decrease delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reactions.
                        </br>DIRECTIONS FOR USE:
                        </br>One (1) tablet twice daily per 20 lbs body weight. Continue as needed.</p>
